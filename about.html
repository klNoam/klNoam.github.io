            <h1>What is Coding Club?</h1>
            <p class="text">Coding club is a club that takes place during Community Time, usually on Thursdays in room 402D. Coding club is an environment where students come to work on the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> they are coding, can ask other students who are good at coding for help with coding those <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, or if a student needs help on their school coding <a href="projects.html">project</a> they have an entire room of experts to help them. Coding Club is a great environment to be in while you are coding (and also while you aren't coding)!</p>
